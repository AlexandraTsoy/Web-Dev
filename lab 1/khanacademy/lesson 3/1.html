<ul>
    <li><a href="https://clever.com/">Clever</a> - Clever is a secure pipeline between school district data and the learning applications that teachers and students use. Users may log onto Clever and immediately access all apps that are made available by the district. </li>
    <li><a href="https://web.seesaw.me/">Seesaw</a> - Seesaw is a digital app-based platform that allows students, teachers, and guardians to complete and share classroom work over a variety of media types (videos, photos, drawings, text, links, and PDFs, to name a few!). </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> - YouTube is a free sharing website owned by Google. While videos on the platform range from entertainment to tutorials to travel videos, a recent Pew research study found that 51% of YouTube users utilize the platform for educational purposes. Popular YouTube channels like National Geographic Kids, Finding Stuff Out, PBS Kids, Simple History, and Khan Academy have become mainstays for educators, especially amidst hybrid and virtual learning. </li>
